# Pandas -- The basics

I wrote these very simple notebooks as I was re(reading) [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do).  I thought it would be useful to have an electronic lookup for when I thought in future "I know I can do this, I just can't remember how."  And doing is the best way of learning.  I doubt these notebooks will be useful to anyone who doesn't already know something of numpy and pandas.
